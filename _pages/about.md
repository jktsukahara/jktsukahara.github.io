I am a prospective Ph.D student, based in Sorbonne Université. I am currently collaborating with [Elias Tsigaridas](https://who.paris.inria.fr/Elias.Tsigaridas/index.html) and [Grégoire Sergeant-Perthuis](https://gregoiresergeant-perthuis.com/) on questions pertaining to [Singular Learning Theory](https://sites.google.com/view/sumiowatanabe/home) and its application to Active Inference and biological systems. 

I graduated from the [MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/) program at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/) with a Master 2. Previously, I obtained a Masters and a Bachelors in Mathematics from [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/).
